Development
===========

Submitting Patches
------------------

- always submit patches as part of a trac ticket (see :ref:`support` for more details)
 
Coding Rules
------------

- always run source code through `pylint`_, using all pylint defaults except for ``C0111``.  ``sbin/pylint-pycsw.sh`` is included for convenience
